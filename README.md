# LastSundayKata
 For the Kata challenge I had to create a method that returns the last sunday of every month for a given year(including leap years). After getting the method to work correctly i then added unit testing for the method using the Nunit package!
 
 ## Below is the despription of the task i had to complete:
 
### The Kata
Write a method that returns the last Sunday of each month for a given year.

#### Example:
last_sunday(2013)
2013-01-27
2013-02-24
2013-03-31
2013-04-28
2013-05-26
2013-06-30
2013-07-28
2013-08-25
2013-09-29
2013-10-27
2013-11-24
2013-12-29

#### Hint:
If you input the year 2020, a leap year, is the last Sunday of February 2020-02-23?
If you input the year 2032, also a leap year, is the last Sunday February 2032-02-29?
